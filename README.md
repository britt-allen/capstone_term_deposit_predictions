# Our Goal
Build a binary classification model to predict if a customer will make a term deposit.

# The Data
The data comes from telemarketing campaigns of a Portuguese bank. Often, more than one contact to the same customer was required, in order to know if a sign up for the product (term deposit) would be (yes) or (no).

Term deposits, also known as, a certificate of deposit, (CD), is a type of savings account that has a fixed interest rate and fixed date of withdrawal, known as the maturity date. Typically there are no risks associated with these and the longer the term length, the more you will earn.
